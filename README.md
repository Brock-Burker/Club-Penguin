## Club Penguin Singleplayer Client (XAMPP-Less)

This is a singleplayer client for Club Penguin, designed for speedrunning.

Download this as a zip and extract it then run `remove_database.bat` then `launch_mysqld.bat` then `install_database.bat` then `start_server.bat` then `start_client.bat`.

# Troubleshooting
## I get connection lost after logging in for the first time!

This is normal. Simply relaunch `start_client.bat` and login with the same name you logged in with the first time.

## I get "Incorrect Password"

Your database is screwed-up in some way. Run `remove_database.bat` then `launch_mysqld.bat` then `install_database.bat` to recreate your database.

## I get an endless loading screen!

Try recreating your database with the above steps and then relaunching.

CPSC uses a lot of code from Kitsune (https://github.com/widd/kitsune) and Zaseth's modified Kitsune (https://github.com/Zaseth/KITSUNE-MODIFIED)
